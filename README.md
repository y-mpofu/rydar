# Rydar - Navigation and Discovery for Informal Transport

## Overview

Rider-first, driver-protecting project that makes multi-leg journeys predictable, safer, and more profitable. Layers on existing behavior: walk to junction, wait, hop on, transfer. Project partners: y-mpofu, siisodaa, uosondu

## Key features

- Driver visibility: signal availability and seats left
- Rider tools: multi-leg routing, ETAs, discreet alight alerts
- Privacy first: no default photo or video capture, passive stop detection, anonymous reporting
- Low-friction access: USSD/SMS fallback for non-smartphone users

## Pilot plan

- Launch in one dense corridor with union and NGO partners and the project team (y-mpofu, siisodaa, uosondu)
- Recruit small cohorts of drivers and riders, offer short incentives, and measure income uplift and trip completion
- Iterate quickly based on field feedback
