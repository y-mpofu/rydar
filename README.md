# Rydar – Navigation and Discovery for Informal Transport

## Overview

Rydar is redefining how people move through Africa’s informal transport networks. In cities accross Nigeria, millions rely on shared taxis, minibuses, and tricycles—affordable yet offline systems that force riders to guess routes, stops, and timing.

Rydar makes this invisible network visible. Enter a start and destination to see real, multi-leg routes with walk segments, informal rides, and transfers. The app highlights pickup spots, shows active driver corridors, and alerts you when to alight. Drivers can share availability effortlessly, staying true to how they already work.

By digitizing everyday mobility, Rydar turns chaos into clarity—making informal transport reliable, connected, and ready to scale across Africa.
