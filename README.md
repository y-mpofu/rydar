# Navigation and Discovery for Informal Transport

## Overview
A rider-first, driver-protecting project that makes multi-leg journeys predictable, safer, and more profitable. Layers on existing behavior: walk to junction, wait, hop on, transfer.

## Key features
- Visibility for drivers: signal availability and seats left.  
- Practical rider tools: multi-leg routing, ETAs, discreet alight alerts.  
- Privacy and trust: no default photo/video capture, passive stop detection, anonymous reporting.  
- Low-friction access: USSD/SMS fallback for non-smartphone users.

## Pilot plan
- Start in one dense corridor with union and NGO partners.  
- Recruit small cohorts of drivers and riders and offer short incentives.  
- Measure income uplift, trip completion, and safety reports; iterate fast.
